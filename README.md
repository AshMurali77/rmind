# RMind: Sample React Native Reminder App

RMind is a frontend project built using React Native and Expo. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for a reminder application where users can set trackers on items, check the location of those items, and receive reminders if items are left behind. This project leverages the power of Figma for wireframing and design.
